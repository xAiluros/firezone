# Local Authentication

By default, Firezone will use local email / password for authenticating users to
the Firezone portal. Administrators can add users and assign their passwords on
the `/users` page. See [Add users](/docs/user-guides/add-users) for more
details.

<Alert color="warning">
  Although local authentication is quick and easy to get started with, you can
  limit attack surface by [disabling local
  authentication](#disabling-local-authentication) altogether. See our
  [OIDC](/docs/authenticate/oidc) or [SAML](/docs/authenticate/saml) guides for
  details. For production deployments it's usually a good idea to **disable
  local authentication** and enforce MFA through your identity provider.
</Alert>

If you choose to keep Local authentication enabled, we recommend
[enabling TOTP-based MFA ](/docs/authenticate/multi-factor) for any accounts
that use the local authentication method.

## Disabling local authentication

Local authentication can be enabled or disabled from the `/settings/security`
page or via the [REST API](/docs/reference/rest-api/configurations). If you've
disabled local authentication and can no longer authenticate to the portal to
re-enable it, see our
[troubleshooting guide ](/docs/administer/troubleshoot#re-enable-local-authentication-via-cli)
for re-enabling local authentication from the CLI.
