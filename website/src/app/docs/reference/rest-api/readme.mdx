# REST API

Welcome to Firezone's REST API v0 documentation.

## Getting started

To get started with the REST API, you'll first need an API token. This can be
generated in the UI at `/settings/account` or via the CLI with:

```bash
docker compose -f $HOME/.firezone/docker-compose.yml exec firezone bin/create-api-token
```

**Note**: The token is written to `STDOUT` by default. You may wish to redirect
its output to a file instead:

```bash
docker compose -f $HOME/.firezone/docker-compose.yml exec firezone bin/create-api-token > fz_token
```

<Alert color="warning">
  API tokens generated from the CLI are owned by the primary administrator
  specified by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable.
