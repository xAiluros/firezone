# Install Firezone with Omnibus

<Alert color="warning">
Due to Omnibus being EOL'd by Chef in 2024, Docker is now the
preferred method of deploying Firezone. See the
[Docker deployment guide](/docs/deploy/docker) to get started.

Read below to continue with an Omnibus-based deployment.

</Alert>

Firezone can be deployed on a server running a supported
[Linux distribution ](/docs/deploy/omnibus/supported-platforms) in a few minutes
with our Debian or Red Hat package. This guide will walk you through the steps
to get started.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

- Ensure you're on a
  [supported Linux distribution](/docs/deploy/omnibus/supported-platforms). A
  kernel upgrade may be required to ensure WireGuard® is available.
- Ensure port forwarding is enabled on your firewall. The default Firezone
  configuration requires the following ports to be open:
  - `80/tcp` (optional): For automatically issuing SSL certificates.
  - `443/tcp`: To access the web UI.
  - `51820/udp`: VPN traffic listen port.

<Alert color="warning">
  Before deploying Firezone in **production**, you'll need a valid DNS record
  pointing to this instance. See [Prepare to
  Deploy](/docs/deploy/#prepare-to-deploy) if you haven't done this already.
</Alert>

<Alert color="info">
  Firezone modifies the kernel netfilter and routing tables. Other programs that
  modify the Linux routing table or firewall may interfere with Firezone’s
  operation. For help troubleshooting connectivity issues, see the
  [troubleshooting guide](/docs/administer/troubleshoot).
</Alert>

## Step 2: Install server

After prerequisites are satisfied, you're ready to install the Firezone Server.

### Option 1: Automatic install

The easiest way to get started using Firezone is via the automatic installation
script below.

```bash
sudo -E bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/firezone/firezone/raw/master/scripts/omnibus_install.sh)"
```

This will ask you a few questions regarding your install, install the latest
release for your platform, create an administrator user, then print to the
console instructions for logging in to the web UI.

<Image className="mx-auto"
  alt="install complete"
  src="/images/install-complete.png"
  width={960}
  height={540}
/>

By default, the web UI can be reached at the IP or domain name of your server.
You can regenerate the admin credentials using the
`firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin` command.

### Option 2: Install from our Debian or RedHat repositories

If the automatic install script fails, try these steps to install Firezone from
our [Cloudsmith repository](https://cloudsmith.io/~firezone/repos/firezone).

1. [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install) for your distro. If
   using Linux kernel 5.6 or higher, skip this step.

1. Install our package repository for your distro's package format:

   - deb packages:

     ```bash
     curl -1sLf \
       'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/firezone/firezone/setup.deb.sh' \
       | sudo -E bash
     ```

   See the
   [Debian setup docs](https://cloudsmith.io/~firezone/repos/firezone/setup/#formats-deb)
   for more options if the script fails to setup the repo.

   - rpm packages:

     ```bash
     curl -1sLf \
       'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/firezone/firezone/setup.rpm.sh' \
       | sudo -E bash
     ```

   See the
   [RedHat setup docs](https://cloudsmith.io/~firezone/repos/firezone/setup/#formats-rpm)
   for more options if the script fails to setup the repo.

1. Install Firezone with your distro's package manager:

   ```bash
   # Using apt
   sudo apt install firezone

   # Using dnf
   sudo dnf install firezone

   # Using yum
   sudo yum install firezone

   # Using zypper
   sudo zypper install firezone
   ```

1. Follow the [bootstrap instructions](#bootstrap-firezone) to setup Firezone.

### Option 3: Manual install

If all else fails, try these steps to install Firezone manually.

1. [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install) for your distro. If
   using Linux kernel 5.6 or higher, skip this step.
1. Download the relevant package for your distribution from the
   [releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
1. Install with `sudo rpm -i firezone*.rpm` or `sudo dpkg -i firezone*.deb`
   depending on your distro.
1. Follow the [bootstrap instructions](#bootstrap-firezone) to setup Firezone.

### Bootstrap Firezone

1. Bootstrap the application with `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`. This will
   initialize config files, set up needed services and generate the default
   configuration.
1. Edit the default configuration located at `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb`. We've
   chosen sensible defaults that should be a good starting point for most
   installations. For production installations, you'll want to specify a valid
   external URL and enable ACME for certificate issuance and renewal:

   ```ruby
   # Auto-generated based on the server's hostname.
   # Set this to the URL used to access the Firezone Web UI.
   default['firezone']['external_url'] = 'https://firezone.example.com'

   # Set the email that will be used for the issued certificates and certifications.
   default['firezone']['ssl']['email_address'] = 'your@email.com'

   # Enable ACME renewal
   default['firezone']['ssl']['acme']['enabled'] = true
   ```

   See the complete
   [configuration file reference for more details ](/docs/reference/configuration-file).

1. Reconfigure the application to pick up the new changes:
   `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`.
1. Finally, create an admin user with `sudo firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin`.
   The login credentials will be printed to the console output.
1. Now you should be able to sign in to the web UI at the URL you specified in
   step 5 above, e.g. `https://firezone.example.com`

[Troubleshoot ](/docs/administer/troubleshoot).

## Step 3: Install client apps

Once successfully deployed, users and devices can be added to connect to the VPN
server:

- [Add Users](/docs/user-guides/add-users): Add users to grant them access to
  your network.
- [Client Instructions](/docs/user-guides/client-instructions): Instructions to
  establish a VPN session.

## Post setup

Congrats! You have completed the setup, but there's a lot more you can do with
Firezone:

- [Integrate your identity provider](/docs/authenticate) for authenticating
  clients
- Using Firezone to
  [establish a static IP](/docs/user-guides/use-cases/nat-gateway)
- Create tunnels between multiple peers with
  [reverse tunnels](/docs/user-guides/use-cases/reverse-tunnel)
- Only route certain traffic through Firezone with
  [split tunneling](/docs/user-guides/use-cases/split-tunnel)
