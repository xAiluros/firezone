# Security considerations

**Disclaimer**: Firezone is still beta software. The codebase has not yet
received a formal security audit. For highly sensitive and mission-critical
production deployments, we recommend disabling local authentication as detailed
[below](#production-deployments).

## List of services and ports

Shown below is a table of default ports used by Firezone services.

## Production deployments

For production deployments of Firezone, we recommend you disable local
authentication altogether by setting
`default['firezone']['authentication']['local']['enabled'] = false`
(Omnibus-based deployments) or `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=false` (Docker-based
deployments). Local authentication can also be disabled on the
`/settings/security` page.

<Alert color="warning">
  Ensure you've set up a working [OIDC](/docs/authenticate/oidc) or
  [SAML](/docs/authenticate/saml)-based authentication provider before disabling
  the local authentication method.
