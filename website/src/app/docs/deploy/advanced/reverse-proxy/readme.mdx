# Custom Reverse Proxy

<Alert color="warning">
  Using a custom reverse proxy is an advanced configuration. The default bundled
  Nginx proxy (Omnibus-based deployments) and Caddy (Docker-based deployments)
  is suitable for the vast majority of use cases and is recommended for most
  users. There are important security risks if the reverse proxy is not set up
  correctly.
</Alert>

## Introduction

Firezone comes with bundled [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com) (Omnibus-based
deployments) or uses Caddy (Docker-based deployments) by default. However, in
some cases you might want to deploy your own server such as when using your own
load balancer.

## Prerequisites

Below you will find the requirements in order to setup Firezone with a custom
reverse proxy.

### Firezone configuration requirements

- Disable the bundled Nginx by setting `default['firezone']['nginx']['enabled']`
  to `false` in the config file.
- If you have any immediate proxies between your primary reverse proxy and the
  Firezone web app, add their IPs to
  `default['firezone']['phoenix']['external_trusted_proxies']`. Because of the
  way the
  [X-Forwarded-For header works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For),
  this is needed to parse the actual client's IP address to prevent IP spoofing.

<Alert color="info">
The `external_trusted_proxies` list automatically implicitly includes the
following private CIDR ranges, even if they're not specified in the
configuration file:

- `127.0.0.0/8`
- `10.0.0.0/8`
- `172.16.0.0/12`
- `192.168.0.0/16`
- `::1/128`
- `fc00::/7`

This means any web requests originating from these IPs are automatically ignored
from the `X-Forwarded-For` headers. If you're accessing Firezone from any IPs in
this range (as seen by the Firezone web app), be sure to add them to the
`default['firezone']['phoenix']['clients']` configuration option instead.

</Alert>

Read more about the configuration options
[here](/docs/reference/configuration-file).

### Proxy requirements

- All your proxies need to configure the `X-Forwarded-For` header as explained
  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)
- Your proxy should also set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` to `https`.
- Your proxy (or another downstream proxy) **must** terminate SSL since we
  enforce
  [secure cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies).
- Firezone requires the use of WebSockets to establish realtime connections. We
  recommend following your proxy's specific documentation for supporting
  WebSockets as each proxy varies. In general, your proxy needs to be able to
  proxy HTTP 1.1 connections, and the Firezone web app expects the following
  headers to be set:
  - `Connection: upgrade`
  - `Upgrade: websocket`

## Security considerations

In addition to the headers above, we recommend adding the following headers for
security purposes:

- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `X-Content-Type-Options nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy no-referrer-when-downgrade`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' ws: wss: http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'; frame-ancestors 'self';`
- `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()`

Since the upstream Firezone web app expects plain HTTP traffic, any requests the
proxy forwards is sent over HTTP and thus is **not encrypted**. In most cases,
the reverse proxy is installed in a trusted network, and this is not an issue.
But the connection between your trusted proxy and the Firezone web app spans an
untrusted network (such as the Internet), you may want to leave the bundled
`nginx` proxy enabled for SSL termination, and set up your custom reverse proxy
to proxy to that instead.

## Example configurations

- [Apache](/docs/reference/reverse-proxy-templates/apache)
- [Traefik](/docs/reference/reverse-proxy-templates/traefik)
- [HAProxy](/docs/reference/reverse-proxy-templates/haproxy)

These configurations are written to be as simple as possible. They're designed
to function as a simple template which you can customize further to suit your
needs.

If you have a working configuration for a different reverse proxy or a different
version of an existing one we appreciate any
[contribution](https://github.com/firezone/firezone) to expand the examples for
the community.
