# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide documents common configuration and connectivity issues. For any
problems that arise, a good first bet is to check the Firezone logs.

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="Docker" active>

Each container stores logs as a JSON file on the host machine. These can be
shown with the `docker logs {CONTAINER}` command. Log files are found at
`var/lib/docker/containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/{CONTAINER_ID}-json.log` by default.

See [debug logs](/docs/administer/debug-logs) for additional details.

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="Omnibus">

Firezone logs are stored in `/var/log/firezone` and can be viewed with
`sudo firezone-ctl tail`.

## Application crash loop preventing config changes

In cases where the application is crash looping because of corrupt,
inaccessible, or invalid OIDC or SAML configuration in the DB, you can try
clearing the affected fields.

For example, to clear OIDC configs:

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="Docker" active>

```
psql -d firezone -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -c "UPDATE configurations SET openid_connect_providers = '[]'"
```

Similarly, to clear SAML configs:

```
psql -d firezone -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -c "UPDATE configurations SET saml_identity_providers = '[]'"
```

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="Omnibus">

```
/opt/firezone/embedded/bin/psql -d $DATABASE_NAME -h $DATABASE_HOST -U $DATABASE_USER -c "UPDATE configurations SET openid_connect_providers = '[]'"
```

Similarly, to clear SAML configs:

```
/opt/firezone/embedded/bin/psql -d $DATABASE_NAME -h $DATABASE_HOST -U $DATABASE_USER -c "UPDATE configurations SET saml_identity_providers = '[]'"
```

## Debugging WebSocket connectivity issues

The Web UI requires a secure websocket connection to function. If a secure
websocket connection can't be established, you'll see a red dot indicator in the
upper-right portion of the Firezone web UI and a corresponding message when you
hover over it:

```
Secure websocket not connected! ...
```

If you're accessing Firezone using the same URL defined in your `EXTERNAL_URL`
variable from above, the issue is likely to be in your reverse proxy
configuration. Ensure your reverse proxy has WebSocket support enabled for
Firezone. If you're using the default Caddy reverse proxy, WebSocket is enabled
and configured automatically.

In most cases, you'll find clues in one or more of the following locations:

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="Omnibus">

- Your browser's developer tool logs, specifically the `Network` tab.
- `sudo firezone-ctl tail nginx`
- `sudo firezone-ctl tail phoenix`

If the websocket connection is successful, you should see output in the
`phoenix` service logs similar the following:

```

## Debugging WireGuard connectivity issues

Most connectivity issues with Firezone are caused by other `iptables` or
`nftables` rules which interfere with Firezone's operation. If you have rules
active, you'll need to ensure these don't conflict with the Firezone rules.

### Internet connectivity drops when tunnel is active

If your Internet connectivity drops whenever you activate your WireGuard tunnel,
you should make sure that the `FORWARD` chain allows packets from your WireGuard
clients to the destinations you want to allow through Firezone.

If you're using `ufw`, this can be done by making sure the default routing
policy is `allow`:

```
ubuntu@fz:~$ sudo ufw default allow routed
Default routed policy changed to 'allow'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly)
```

A `ufw` status for a typical Firezone server might look like this:

```
ubuntu@fz:~$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), allow (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
80/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
443/tcp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
51820/udp                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
443/tcp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
51820/udp (v6)             ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

## Admin login isn't working

If the password for the account with email `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` isn't working,
you can reset it using the process below.

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="Docker" active>

First change directory to your Firezone installation directory
(`$HOME/.firezone` by default), then run the `bin/create-or-reset-admin` script
to reset the admin user's password. The password for the user specified by
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` in `$HOME/.firezone/.env` will be reset to the
`DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` variable.

```bash
cd $HOME/.firezone
docker compose exec firezone bin/create-or-reset-admin
```

**Note**: If local authentication is disabled, resetting the admin user's
password will not re-enable it.

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="Omnibus">

Run the following command to reset the password on the default admin user.

```bash
sudo firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin
```

</TabsItem>
</TabsGroup>

## Re-enable local authentication via CLI

If you've configured an [OIDC](/docs/authenticate/oidc) or
[SAML](/docs/authenticate/saml) provider, you can consider disabling local
authentication for additional security.

If, however, issues arise with your identity provider integration, it's possible
you could be locked out of the admin portal. To re-enable local authentication
so you can log in and resolve the issue, you can temporarily re-enable local
authentication via the [REST API](/docs/reference/rest-api/configurations).

If that's not an option, you can re-enable local authentication by running the
following commands on the host of your Firezone instance:

```bash
cd $HOME/.firezone
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1 -d firezone -c "UPDATE configurations SET local_auth_enabled = 't'"
```
