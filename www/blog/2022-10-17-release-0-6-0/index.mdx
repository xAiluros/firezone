## Firezone 0.6 Released!

Today, I'm excited to announce we've closed the
[first public issue ](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/260) on our
GitHub repository, more than a year after it was originally opened:
Containerization support! We're also releasing preliminary support for SAML 2.0
identity providers like Okta and OneLogin.

### Docker Support

Docker is now the preferred method for deploying Firezone. Our
[ automatic install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_install.sh)
now uses Docker by default, and we even have a new
[Docker migration script ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_migrate.sh)
that will non-destructively migrate your Omnibus-based Firezone installation to
a Docker-based one with minimal downtime.

#### How to Deploy

You can now deploy Firezone complete with valid SSL certificates and a
provisioned administrator in just a couple minutes:

<AsciinemaPlayer
  src="https://asciinema.org/a/530197.cast"
  autoplay={true}
  rows={30}
  idleTimeLimit={3}
  preload={true}
/>

This also means Firezone runs on any platform that supports Docker, like my Mac
in the video above. The automatic install script will _probably_ barf on
Windows, though. In that case, try the
[manual install method](/docs/deploy/docker/#option-2-manual-install)!

#### Why Docker?

Docker offers a number of benefits over the old Omnibus-based method of
deploying Firezone:

- **Simpler, more robust upgrades**: In most cases, simply pull the latest
  `firezone/firezone` image and restart the container.
- **Simpler configuration**: Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can now
  be done in the web UI instead of the `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb` configuration
  file. All other configuration variables can be specified as ENV vars to the
  Firezone container.
- **Smaller footprint**: The Firezone image weighs in at a couple dozen
  megabytes versus hundreds of megabytes for the Omnibus package.
- **Portability**: Firezone now runs on any platform that supports Docker.
- **Security**: Containerization providers better security isolation than simply
  running as an unprivileged local user.

It also makes it easier to build and test Firezone. CI pipelines rejoice! No
more 4-hour long compiles and intermittent build failures.

#### What about Omnibus?

[Chef Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) is a Ruby-based build system
designed to make building and distributing complex software easier. You define
your dependencies as source tarballs, configure options, and platform-specific
build flags, and Omnibus automatically fetches, builds, and links all your
dependencies automagically, emitting an OS-native installer artifact when
complete.

Omnibus was a popular choice for distributing self-hosted software before Docker
was popular -- GitLab and Mattermost are two popular self-hosted products that
still support Omnibus-based deployments today. It's still used in many cases
where Docker can't be used (on the \*BSDs, for example).

But, since Omnibus is [effectively EOL in 2024](https://docs.chef.io/versions/)
due to its reliance on Chef Infra Client, we've decided to deprioritize reliance
on it, and dedicate those resources to containerized deployments instead.

**Note**: Beginning with 0.6, Omnibus support in Firezone is **deprecated**.
We'll be removing support for it completely in a future Firezone release.

#### How to migrate from Omnibus to Docker

We've written an in-depth migration guide to migrate your instance from Omnibus
to Docker:

https://www.firezone.dev/docs/administer/migrate

Most instances will migrate without issue. If you're running Firezone in
production for your team or business, [contact us](/contact/sales) so we can
better understand how we can help with your migration.

### SAML 2.0

Also in 0.6 is preliminary support for SAML 2.0 authentication. You'll need the
IdP Metadata XML document to set it up. In most cases the identity provider will
provide it for you. If not, you should be able to build it manually or using a
tool such as
[this nifty online IdP builder](https://www.samltool.com/idp_metadata.php).

In general we recommend using OpenID Connect integration over SAML whenever
possible. It's simpler, tends to be implemented more consistently across
identity providers, and much easier to debug when things go wrong.

Speaking of OIDC, 0.6 also introduces a couple improvements to make integrating
your identity provider a more pleasant experience:

- `auto_create_oidc_users` is now a per-provider configuration setting. Enable
  or disable autocreation of users when logging into Firezone via that provider.
- New web form for entering OIDC details, with improved validation and error
  checking:

integrations, [contact us](/contact/sales) to learn more about custom
