# Integrate your identity provider using OIDC

Firezone supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via OpenID Connect (OIDC).

## Supported identity providers

In general, most identity providers that offer OIDC support work with Firezone.
Some providers that only implement the OIDC partially or use uncommon
configurations may have issues, however. If your identity provider falls into
this category, [contact us ](/contact/sales) about a custom integration.

The following OIDC providers are known to work well with Firezone:

| Provider                              | Support Status                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |

## General setup guide

If you're using an OIDC provider not listed above, the following OIDC attributes
are required for setting up an OIDC provider in Firezone:

1. `discovery_document_uri`: The
   [OpenID Connect provider configuration URI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig)
   which returns a JSON document used to construct subsequent requests to this
   OIDC provider. Some providers refer to this as the "well-known URL".
1. `client_id`: The client ID of the application.
1. `client_secret`: The client secret of the application.
1. `redirect_uri`: Instructs OIDC provider where to redirect after
   authentication. This should be your Firezone
   `EXTERNAL_URL + /auth/oidc/<provider_key>/callback/` (e.g.
   `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/google/callback/`).
1. `response_type`: Set to `code`.
1. `scope`:
   [OIDC scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#Scopes)
   to obtain from your OIDC provider. At a minimum, Firezone requires the
   `openid` and `email` scopes.
1. `label`: The button label text displayed on the Firezone portal login page.

### PKCE

Firezone supports Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for increased login
security. We recommend you enable PKCE in your IdP's settings whenever
available. [Read more about PKCE here](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

### OIDC logout URI

The OpenID Connect standard
[defines a mechanism](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html)
for a Relying Party (RP) to request that an OpenID Provider log out the
End-User.

Unfortunately, not all IdPs support this (e.g. Google, Auth0). For the providers
that do support this mechanism, Firezone automatically detects the
`end_session_uri` found in the provider's discovery document and uses that to
log out the End-User.
